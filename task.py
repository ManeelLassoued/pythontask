#Problem Solving:How to accept inputs
# Ok - so let us begin your journey.For solving programming problems, your code needs to accept system provided inputs.The input()input() function in Python allows user input.
#
#     The default parameter accepted in the input()
#     input() function is a string
#     Even numbers in user input are treated as characters or strings in this method
#
# Task
# Write a code to accept a string as input and output the same.
# Some portion of the code is already written for you.
# You need to replace the _ (underscores) with correct code in the editor.Input:
# AbcdOutput:
# AbcdCode :
# Replace the _ (underscores) in the code below 
#S = _____()
# print(_)
#Now write your solution from here:
S = input()
print(S)
