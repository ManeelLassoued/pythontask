#Problem Solving:How to accept inputs
# Ok - so let us begin your journey.For solving programming problems, your code needs to accept system provided inputs.The input()input() function in Python allows user input.
#
#     The default parameter accepted in the input()
#     input() function is a string
#     Even numbers in user input are treated as characters or strings in this method
#
# Task
# Write a code to accept a string as input and output the same.
# Some portion of the code is already written for you.
# You need to replace the _ (underscores) with correct code in the editor.Input:
# AbcdOutput:
# AbcdCode :
# # Replace the _ (underscores) in the code belowS = _____()
# print(_)
#   2:00 PM
# Problem Solving:How to accept integer inputs
# In the previous problem, we saw that input()input() assumes the input to be of type stringstring.Task
# Let us define a variable NN that accepts integer inputs.
# Output the same variable NN.
# To convert the input into an integerinteger, we use the int()int() function.Sample 1:
# Input:
# 4312Output:
# 4312Code:
# # Update the blanks in the code belowN = int(___)
# print(_)
#Now write your solution from here:
S = input()
print(S)
