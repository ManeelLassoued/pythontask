# Problem Solving :
#Debug this code - Why is this code incorrect
#So as you solve programming problems - you will need to debug and find errors in your own code.Task
#You are given a program which does the following

 #   Accepts the count of test cases - t in the 1st line
 #   The only line of each test case consists of an integer N
 #   For each test case, output to the console the value that is double the integer N

#Can you try and 'debug / fix' the error in the given program?Sample 1:
#Input

#3
#1
#2
#3

#Output:

#2
#4
#6

#Code:

# Debug the following code to solve the problem

#t = input()
#for i in range(t)
    #    N = int(input())
    #    print(2*N)

#Now write your solution from here:
# Debug the following code to solve the problem

t =  int(input())
for i in range(t):
    N = int(input())
    print(2*N)
