#Problem Solving:
# What are test cases
# In the previous problem - we wrote the program to accept 5 inputs on 5 separate lines.

#    What will we do if we expect 100 inputs or test cases?
#   What about 100,000 inputs or test cases?

#For taking a lot of test cases as input, we use loops.
#In the last problem, we told you that the number of test cases was 5.
#Usually the number of test cases is the first input you take and then take that input for each test case.
#Consider this test case
#2
#4
#5

#Here 2 is the number of test cases. 4 and 5 are the the input for 1st and 2nd test case respectively. A code for taking and printing this test cases will be:

#t = int(input())
#for i in range(t):
#    n = int(input())
#    print(n)

# Output
#4
#5

#    We took the input for 't', the number of test cases in the first line.
 #   Then we ran a loop which will go from 0 to '(t-1)', using the range function.
  #  For each test case, we input the value in 'n' and printed it.

#Task
#Write a program in the IDE which does the following

 #   Accepts the count of test cases - t - as an integer input given in the 1st line.
 #   This is followed by t lines - Each line contains an integer N
 #   For each test cases, prints out the integer N to console on a separate line
#Sample 1:
#Input
#3
#1
#22
#33
#Output
#1
#22
#33

#Explanation:
#Since the count of test cases is 3 -> we accept 3 inputs and print 3 outputsCode:

# accept the count of test cases given in the the 1st line
#t = int(input())

# run a loop to accept 't' inputs
#for i in range(t):
#    N = int(_______)
#    _____(N)
# Debug the following code to solve the problem


t = int(input())

for i in range(t):
    N = int(input())
    print(N)
