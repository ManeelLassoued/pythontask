#Problem Solving:
# Test cases
# In the previous module, we practiced simple methods of Input and Output used in programming problems.Let us take the next small step and learn about test cases.
# For a lot of problems, you will have to solve the task for multiple test cases.
# Example: Consider 5 test cases or 5 inputs
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
#
# TaskWrite a program in the IDE which does the following
#
#     Accepts 5 inputs given on 5 separate lines. Each input is an integer N
#     For each test cases, prints out the integer N to console on a separate line
#Sample 1:
# Input
#11
#123
#34
#22
#45
#Sample 1:
#Output
#11
#123
#34
#22
#45
#Explanation:
#Since the count of test cases is 5 -> we accept 5 inputs and print 5 outputsCode:
# Update the '_' in the code belowA = int(input())
#B = int(_)
#C = int(_)
#D = int(input())
#E = int(input())
#print(A)
#print(_)
#_____(C)
#print(D)
#print(E)
#Now write your solution from here:

A = int(input())
B = int(input())
C = int(input())
D = int(input())
E = int(input())
print(A)
print(B)
print(C)
print(D)
print(E)
